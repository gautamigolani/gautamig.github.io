## Abstract

<div align="justify">
For the past few years, manipulators have been used for a number of different applications mainly due to their cost-effectiveness and flexibility, apart from other numerous advantages they offer. With the thought of exploring manipulators in detail, I have developed a complete path planning and control framework for a manipulator in this project, giving an insight into the area of planning for the UR5 manipulator (case study). The kinematic equations are first derived, following which the computed-torque controller is designed with the help of the dynamic equations. For path planning, a repetitive motion planning (RMP) scheme is analyzed and implemented on the manipulator. The models for the same are developed in Simulink while Simscape Multibody presents a new way of visualizing the model and observing its movement. Simulations are carried out at a later stage to verify whether the results obtained have substantiated the planning model or not.</div>
