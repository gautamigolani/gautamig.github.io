## Abstract

<div align="justify">
When a mobile manipulator tracks a defined path, it must be ensured that both the manipulator and the mobile base are simultaneously obeying the set parameters and conditions efficiently. However, this task can become challenging if the scheme is non-repetitive in nature and the system is redundant and bound
by limits, which if not considered can lead to a rise in non-linearities. In this paper, we present a planning scheme that helps solve these issues. Another topic of prime concern is limits of the system. When the mobile robot is working towards an assigned task in any environment, it becomes important to make sure that the system obeys its limits; exceeding them would cause damage to it in the long run. A solution to overcome these issues has been presented within this paper, wherein we propose a motion planning scheme for mobile robot manipulators (MRM), one which can readily handle these limits and also
solve the hassle of redundancy. We begin by establishing the kinematic model and thereby solve the linear system we have formed. We then describe the design methodology of the scheme which is based on the neurodynamics model and makes use of defined error functions. Further, simulations of the MRM
synthesized by the proposed planing scheme is implemented with the results illustrated to verify its performance.
