## Abstract

The Vision Based Autonomous Assistance Robot is a mobile robot that is able to assist people in
locating the classes and labs of the various departments in Manipal Academy of Higher Education,
Dubai. Upon receiving a query for a location from a person, the robot gives directions both by
speech and by pointing its arm towards the selected destination. An application on the tablet
provided to the person has a list of classes and laboratories that the person can choose from based
on his/her requirements. The robot is placed in the reception area of the campus and when a person
stands facing the robot, the camera detects the face and welcomes the guest. The web camera
attached to the top of the robot and the ultrasonic sensors fixed to the bottom of the robot allows
the robot to avoid collision as well as to know its way around the campus while giving directions.
This application can also be incorporated in other locations such as in a museum or an exhibition
so as to minimize the need for guides.
