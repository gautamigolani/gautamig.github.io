## Abstract
<div align="justify">
The Vision Based Autonomous Assistance Robot is a mobile robot that is able to assist people in
locating the classes and labs of the various departments in MAHE, Dubai. Upon receiving a query for a location from a person, the robot gives directions both by speech and by pointing its arm towards the selected destination. An application on the tablet provided to the person has a list of classes and laboratories that people can choose from based on their requirements. The robot is placed in the reception area of the campus and when a person stands facing the robot, the camera detects the face and welcomes the guest. The web camera attached to the top of the robot and the ultrasonic sensors fixed to the bottom of the robot allows the robot to avoid collision as well as to know its way around the campus while giving directions. This application can also be incorporated in other locations such as in a museum or an exhibition so as to minimize the need for guides.</div>
