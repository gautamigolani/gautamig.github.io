## Abstract
<div align="justify">
The general purpose of a guidance robot is to assist human beings, typically by executing a task that is dull, distant, or repetitive. In the last decade robotic research has moved from stationary robotic systems in constrained environments to mobile and service-oriented robots operating in realistic and unconstrained environments. The new generations of service robots are expected to be flexible as well as capable of performing several diverse tasks simultaneously. Motivated by this, we have developed a service robot for use in a known environment. The Vision Based Autonomous Assistance Robot is a mobile robot that is able to assist people in locating the classes and labs of the various departments in MAHE, Dubai. The robot is capable of detecting a person standing in front of it via a camera and upon receiving the person's query for a particular location through a tablet, the robot gives directions both by speech and by pointing its arm towards the selected destination. The ultrasonic sensors fixed to the bottom of the robot allows the robot to avoid collision around the campus while giving directions. This application can also be incorporated in other locations such as in a museum or an exhibition so as to minimize the need for guides.</div>
