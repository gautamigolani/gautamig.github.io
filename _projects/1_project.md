## Abstract

<div align="justify">
Repetitive planning schemes have been around for quite some time but utilizing them for redundant mobile manipulators is quite complex due to the rise in singularity and increasing degrees of freedom (DOFs). In this paper, a new path planning scheme is proposed with redundancy resolving ability is also repetitive in nature. The general approach would be to use the already existing pseudo-inverse method but due to its shortcomings the scheme we developed is based on an integration of the pseudo-inverse approach, with feedback control, and Zhangâ€™s neural network (ZNN), which is a neurodynamics design model. Computer simulations are carried out on an omnidirectional mobile manipulator (OMM) synthesized by three paths to substantiate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
