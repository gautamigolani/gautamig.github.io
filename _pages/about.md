Hi there!

I am currently a Research Associate at [`CARTIN`](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/cartin) in NTU, Singapore, working with [Prof. Domenico Campolo's](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00604) group. Previously, I spent half a year as a Robotics Intern at `SonyAI`, Tokyo working on the flagship Gastronomy project. 

As for my education, I hold an M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, specializing in Controls & Automation, from the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). Here, I was fortunate to be adviced by [Prof. Sam Shuzhi Ge](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/ge-shuzhi-sam/) with whom I worked on my master’s thesis at the Control & Simulation Lab which was focused on developing new path planning schemes for an omni-directional mobile manipulator.

Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics Engineering with a minor in Robotics & Automation from [Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), Dubai](https://www.manipaldubai.com/). My undergraduate thesis was focused on the development of an autonomous robot, done under the mentorship of [Prof. Royson Dsouza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/royson-dsouza-a20092141/?originalSubdomain=fi) at the Manipal Centre of Robotics Excellence Laboratory.
