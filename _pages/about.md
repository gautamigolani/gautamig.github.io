    <p>Hi there!</p>

    <p>I am currently a Research Associate at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/cartin">CARTIN</a> in NTU, Singapore, working with <a href="https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00604">Prof. Domenico Campolo's</a> group. Previously, I spent half a year as a Robotics Intern at <a href="https://www.sonyai.com/">SonyAI</a>, Tokyo, where I worked on the flagship Gastronomy project, further developing my skills in robotics and mechanical design.</p>

    <p>I hold an M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, specializing in Controls & Automation, from the <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a>. I had the privilege of being advised by <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/ge-shuzhi-sam/">Prof. Sam Shuzhi Ge</a>, with whom I developed my master’s thesis at the Control & Simulation Lab, focusing on innovative path planning schemes for an omni-directional mobile manipulator. This experience deepened my interest in mechanical design and its applications in robotics.</p>

    <p>Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics Engineering with a minor in Robotics & Automation from <a href="https://www.manipaldubai.com/">Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), Dubai</a>. My undergraduate thesis, supervised by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/royson-dsouza-a20092141/?originalSubdomain=fi">Prof. Royson Dsouza</a> at the Manipal Centre of Robotics Excellence Laboratory, involved developing an autonomous robot, which sparked my passion for designing complex mechanical systems.</p>
