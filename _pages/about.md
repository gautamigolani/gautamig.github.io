Hi there!

I’m currently a Research Intern at `SonyAI`. I graduated from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), where I received an M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, specializing in Controls & Automation. Here, I was fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Sam Shuzhi Ge](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/ge-shuzhi-sam/) and be a part of his research group. I worked on my master’s thesis under his advice at the Control & Simulation Lab which was focused on developing new motion planning schemes for an omni-directional mobile manipulator.

Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics Engineering with a minor in Robotics & Automation from [Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), Dubai](https://www.manipaldubai.com/). My undergraduate thesis was focused on the development of an autonomous robot, done under the mentorship of [Prof. Royson Dsouza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/royson-dsouza-a20092141/?originalSubdomain=fi) at the Manipal Centre of Robotics Excellence Laboratory.</div>
